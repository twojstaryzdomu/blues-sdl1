# Blues Brothers

This is a rewrite of the [Blues Brothers](https://www.mobygames.com/game/blues-brothers) and [Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure](https://www.mobygames.com/game/blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure) game engines developed by [Titus Interactive](https://www.mobygames.com/company/titus-interactive-sa).

There is also support for [Prehistorik 2](https://www.mobygames.com/game/prehistorik-2).

## Requirements

### Blues Brothers

The data files of the Amiga or DOS version, full game or [demo](https://archive.org/details/TheBluesBrothers_1020), are required.

```
*.BIN, *.CK1, *.CK2, *.SQL, *.SQV, *.SQZ
```

For sounds and music, the Amiga version files or the [ExoticA](https://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers) set need to be copied.

### Jukebox Adventure

The data files of the DOS version are required.

```
*.EAT, *.MOD
```

### Prehistorik 2

The data files of the DOS version, full game or [demo](http://cd.textfiles.com/ccbcurrsh1/demos/pre2.zip), are required.

```
*.SQZ, *.TRK
```

## Changes

Compared to the original DOS executables, the rewritten engines feature:

- horizontal scrolling
- configurable screen size
- dynamically resizable window to control game screen size
- in-game screen controls for screen size & palette
- on-screen messaging
- game cheats: unlimited lifes and energy, no hit
- game pad support with a user-defined jump button

## Screen controls

In addition to the default controls, the engine provides several convenience
in-game keys for display control.

The screen size lock allows to hold a given game screen size whilst manipulating
the window.

In-game palette cycling is only available in Prehistorik 2.

|    Key(s)   |               Function               |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------|
|      A      | Toggle audio                         |
|      H      | Toggle Hybrid crack palette bug      |
|      O      | Restore original screen size         |
|      P      | Pause game                           |
|      S      | Toggle screen size lock              |
| ALT + Enter | Toggle fullscreen <=> windowed mode  |
|      -      | Cycle to previous palette            |
|     + =     | Cycle to next palette                |

By default, the executable loads the data files from the current directory.
This can be changed using command line switches.
